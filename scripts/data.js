        "Balancing content fidelity and artistic style is a pivotal challenge in image generation. While traditional style transfer methods and modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) strive to achieve this balance, they often struggle to do so without sacrificing either style, content, or sometimes both. This work addresses this challenge by analyzing the ability of DDPMs to maintain content and style equilibrium. We introduce a novel method to identify sensitivities within the DDPM attention layers, identifying specific layers that correspond to different stylistic aspects. By directing conditional inputs only to these sensitive layers, our approach enables fine-grained control over style and content, significantly reducing issues arising from over-constrained inputs. Our findings demonstrate that this method enhances recent stylization techniques by better aligning style and content, ultimately improving the quality of generated visual content.",

      "Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts, when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific setting.",
      "We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between their guiding parameters.",

        "Diffusion models dominate the space of text-to-image generation, yet they may produce undesirable outputs, including explicit content or private data. To mitigate this, concept ablation techniques have been explored to limit the generation of certain concepts. In this paper, we reveal that the erased concept information persists in the model and that erased concept images can be generated using the right latent. Utilizing inversion methods, we show that there exist latent seeds capable of generating high quality images of erased concepts. Moreover, we show that these latents have likelihoods that overlap with those of images outside the erased concept. We extend this to demonstrate that for every image from the erased concept set, we can generate many seeds that generate the erased concept. Given the vast space of latents capable of generating ablated concept images, our results suggest that fully erasing concept information may be intractable, highlighting possible vulnerabilities in current concept ablation techniques.",

We focus on Normalizing Flows because they can calculate the exact generation probability likelihood for a given image. We demonstrate taming using models that generate human faces, a subdomain with many interesting privacy and bias considerations. Our method can be used in the context of privacy, e.g., removing a specific person from the output of a model, and also in the context of debiasing by forcing a model to output specific image categories according to a given target distribution. Taming is achieved with a fast fine-tuning process without retraining the model from scratch, achieving the goal in a matter of minutes. We evaluate our method qualitatively and quantitatively, showing that the generation quality remains intact, while the desired changes are applied.",

We demonstrate how AI systems can participate successfully in improvisational co-creation, moving beyond response generation to collaborative story-telling. We provide a systematic framework for evaluating creative AI outputs in improvisational contexts, combining human evaluation with computational metrics. Our evaluations show that stories co-created with an AI agent are indistinguishable from stories co-created with a human in terms of novelty, value, and surprise. This shows how 'hallucinations' - typically considered problematic in AI systems - can serve as creative assets in collaborative storytelling. More generally, our approach presents the 'Yes! andâ€¦' game as a novel model-system for studying improvised co-creativity in a well-defined and measurable setup"

        "Image tilingâ€”the seamless connection of disparate images to create a coherent visual fieldâ€”is crucial for applications such as texture creation, video game asset development, and digital art. Traditionally, tiles have been constructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in scalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this process using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360Â° synthesis.",
